          Ever wonder if all our most significant problems-climate change, disease, plastic waste- could have one tiny
          solution? Thanks to an incredible AI breakthrough, they just might!

          Proteins are like tiny machines in every living thing. They start as simple strings of amino acids but fold
          into complex 3D shapes, due to their various chemical bonds, and this shape determines what they do. Given
          this, it's little surprise that tens of thousands of scientists have been painstakingly trying to determine
          and catalogue protein shapes.
